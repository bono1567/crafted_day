We are mainly using **Pandas** and **NumPy** to do so.

## Visualtion
This module deals with th visualisation of the data using **Bokeh**

## Predictor
This module will have the prediction interface (PENDING)

## Model
This module will have the prediction models. (PENDING)
Mainly using **Tensorflow 2.0** and **sklearn**.
